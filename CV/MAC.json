Nowadays, I am mostly interested in back-end development and systems' scalability. \n\nMy hopes are that, whilst keeping doing what I love, I will also have the chance to improve people's lives around me. That's why it is important for me to know that my work has a positive impact (yeah, the idealist kind of guy, I know). Ideally, I would like to be involved in projects related to climate change, healthcare, education and social justice. ",
